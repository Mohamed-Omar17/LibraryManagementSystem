There will be a lot of output lines before ability for input. These are just to make sure the Nodes in the AVL tree are balanced, along with the insertion time of each node/book.

4. Four options will be available: type the number and then press enter to select the option
*Options and what they do

1. Lets you search for a book, and borrow if you don't have it, return it if you do, or inform you that it doesn't exist
2. Outputs user borrowed books
3. Shows available books
4. Exits the library

*NOTE*
The first 2 node insertions will have exception insertion times to allocate memory for the tree creation, and the first 2 searches will take longer than expected, as the tree will be elevating in the CPU hierarchy
